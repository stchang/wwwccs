<h1>Thesis Proposal for Stephen Chang</h1>

<ol>

<p><li> <strong>Title:</strong>
Laziness By Need.



<p><li> <strong>Abstract:</strong> <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lazy functional programming comes with many benefits that strict
functional languages can simulate via lazy data constructors. For 
example, the use of lazy data structures can simplify the composition of
components and improve the performance of a program. In recognition, 
ML and Scheme have supported lazy stream programming with
delay and force for several decades. Unfortunately, the manual insertion 
of delay and force is tedious for the most part, challenging in
a few instances, and hence truly error-prone.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this proposal, we present a semantics-based refactoring that
helps strict programmers manage manual lazy programming.
The refactoring uses a static analysis to identify the points where forces
and additional delays are needed to achieve the desired simplification
and performance benefits, once the programmer has added the initial
lazy data constructors. The proposal presents a correctness argument
for the underlying transformations and some preliminary experiences
with a prototype tool implementation.

Greg Morrisett initially sparked my interest in lazy programming
languages. David Van Horn's work on static analysis is directly related to my
work. Eli Barzilay's work on lazy languages is also related to my
work. Finally, Amal Ahmed's work on types and mutable state is related to my
planned future work.
<!--
Prof. Ahmed's and Prof. Wand's contributions to proof techniques for
program properties and observational equivalences has influenced my research.
Prof. Flanagan has worked on static
debugging, type system design, and behavioral/temporal contracts, which is
closely related to my work.
