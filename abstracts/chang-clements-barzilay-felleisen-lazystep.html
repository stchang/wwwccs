<blockquote>
<p>
Debugging lazy functional programs poses serious challenges. Due to the
 complicated nature of lazy evaluation, some debugging tools abandon laziness
 altogether. Other debuggers preserve laziness but present it in a way that may
 confuse programmers because the focus of evaluation jumps around in a
 seemingly random manner.
</p><p>
In this paper, we introduce the algebraic program stepper as a new debugging
 tool for lazy programs. We conjecture that our tool is suitable for clarifying
 the confusing nature of laziness. Preliminary classroom experiences have
 confirmed a prototype implementation of the stepper as a useful tool for
 novice programmers and programmers new to lazy programming.
</p><p>
Mathematically speaking, our stepper renders lazy computations as the standard
 rewriting sequences of a program rewriting system. Our lazy semantics
 introduces lazy evaluation as a form of parallel program rewriting. The
 semantics resembles graph reduction but remains intuitive for programmers
 because it emphasizes the source syntax. As a <em>syntactic semantics</em>,
 our rewriting system represents a compromise between Launchbury's store-based
 semantics and a simple, axiomatic description of lazy computation as
 sharing-via-parameters.  We prove an equivalence between our system and both
 of these semantics.
</p><p>
The stepper's implementation leverages Racket's continuation marks for stack
 trace generation. We can therefore exploit existing models of continuation
 marks and a correctness proof of Racket's eager algebraic stepper to prove the
 correctness of our lazy stepper.
