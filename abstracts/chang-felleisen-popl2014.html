<blockquote>
<p>
While many programmers appreciate the benefits of lazy programming at an
 abstract level, determining which parts of a concrete program to evaluate
 lazily poses a significant challenge for most of them. Over the past
 thirty years, experts have published numerous papers on the problem, but
 developing this level of expertise requires a significant amount of
 experience.
</p><p> 
<p>
We present a profiling-based technique that captures and automates this
 expertise for the insertion of laziness annotations into strict programs. To
 make this idea precise, we show how to equip a formal semantics with a metric
 that measures waste in an evaluation. Then we explain how to implement this
 metric as a dynamic profiling tool that suggests where to insert laziness
 into a program. Finally, we present evidence that our profiler's suggestions
 either match or improve on an expert's use of laziness in a range of
 real-world applications.
