<blockquote>
<p>
Reasoning about misbehaving lazy functional programs can
be confusing, particularly for novice programmers. Unfortunately, the
complicated nature of laziness also renders most debugging tools ineffective 
at clarifying this confusion. In this paper, we introduce a new
lazy debugging tool for novice programmers, an algebraic stepper that
presents computation as a sequence of parallel rewriting steps. Parallel
program rewriting represents sharing accurately and enables debugging
at the level of source syntax, minimizing the presentation of low-level 
details or the effects of distorting transformations that are typical for other
lazy debuggers. Semantically, our rewriting system represents a 
compromise between Launchbury's store-based semantics and an axiomatic
description of lazy computation as sharing-via-parameters. Finally, we
prove the correctness of our tool by showing that the stepper's run-time
machinery reconstructs the expected lazy rewriting sequence.
