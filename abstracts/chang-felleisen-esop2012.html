<blockquote>
<p>
The existing call-by-need &#955 calculi describe lazy evaluation via
 equational logics. A programmer can use these logics to safely ascertain
 whether one term is behaviorally equivalent to another or to determine the
 value of a lazy program. However, neither of the existing calculi models
 evaluation in a way that matches lazy implementations.
</p><p> 
Both calculi suffer from the same two problems. First, the calculi never
 discard function calls, even after they are completely resolved. Second, the
 calculi include re-association axioms even though these axioms are merely
 administrative steps with no counterpart in any implementation.
</p><p>
In this paper, we present an alternative axiomatization of lazy evaluation
 using a single axiom. It eliminates both the function call retention problem
 and the extraneous re-association axioms. Our axiom uses a grammar of contexts
 to describe the exact notion of a <em>needed computation</em>. Like its
 predecessors, our new calculus satisfies consistency and standardization
 properties and is thus suitable for reasoning about behavioral equivalence. In
 addition, we establish a correspondence between our semantics and Launchbury's
 natural semantics.
