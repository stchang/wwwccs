          <p> This paper describes a novel abstract machine for a lazy
            evaluator. Stephen came up with the idea during a 
            <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/379-s09/index.html">
            class project</a> and devised the machine semantics and proved its
            correctness.</p>

          <p> I wrote the introduction and Stephen wrote the rest of the
          paper. David provided feedback on the models and verified the proofs
          in the paper. All authors were involved in editing the paper into its
          final form.</p>

          <p> This paper describes the general framework of a debugging tool
          for lazy programming languages. The tool is implemented in Lazy
          Racket, but is based on continuation marks, making it easily ported
          to any other language. Our debugger is a direct extension of the
          Racket Stepper for the student languages. I suggested the new lazy
          semantics and Stephen utilized it when he implemented the tool in
          Lazy Racket.</p>
          
          <p> I wrote the introduction and Stephen wrote the rest of the
            paper. Eli and John provided advice and guidance on Lazy Racket and
            the previous Stepper, respectively, as well as provided feedback on
            the design of the Lazy Stepper. Stephen and I edited the paper into
            its final form.</p>

        <td><p> This paper describes a new characterization of lazy evaluation
        that improves on existing models by following machine implementations
        more closely. Stephen proposed the idea and we jointly worked out the
        final semantics. Stephen then proved the essential properties and
        correctness of the system.</p>
